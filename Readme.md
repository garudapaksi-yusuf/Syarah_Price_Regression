## About

Syarah is an online platform specializing on used cars sales. If there is someone willing to sell their cars to Syarah, they may start by inputting information regarding their cars (such as `make`, `type`, manufacturing `year`, `mileage`, etc.) to Syarah's website and mobile application. Next up, Syarah's representative are going to contact you directly to do some inspection and documenting the cars that you would like to sell. After signing the required documents, Syarah will transfer you the money based on any previous agreements.

This stage of inspection done by Syarah before deciding on the agreed `price` to their clients may potentially become a problem in this kind of used cars sales business, because **it requires a relatively significant amount of time, from clients providing information about their cars until Syarah gives a proper buying price**. This period of time may reduce the willingness of Syarah's client, and instead selling their cars to competitors or any other easier way.

Therefore, Syarah needs a tool to help them and their clients **to predict & decide the price of used cars immediately; potentially before any inspection done to them**. Many kinds of information to separate between one used car and another, such as `region` where they sell the car and their `origin` (country of importer), `gear type`, trim `options`, and also used cars' `engine size`, may improve the accuracy of price prediction, thereby providing benefits and added value for Syarah and their clients.
